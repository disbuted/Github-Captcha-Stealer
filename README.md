## **Project Overview**

**Github-Captcha-Stealer** was designed as a **CAPTCHA Website** aimed at deceiving users into thinking they were solving a CAPTCHA challenge. Behind the scenes, the website would stealthily deploy an **infostealer** malware onto the target's system. 

The **Lumma Stealer** malware, once deployed, is a paid malware-for-hire service that allows malicious actors to extract a wide variety of sensitive data from compromised systems, including:

- **Login credentials** from web browsers, FTP clients, and email clients
- **Browser-stored passwords** and autofill data
- **Cookies** and session tokens, enabling account hijacking
- **Cryptocurrency wallets** and private keys
- **System information** such as IP address, operating system details, and hardware info
- **Clipboard data**, including copied passwords, addresses, and other sensitive info
- **Telegram sessions**, allowing access to conversations and accounts

Lumma Stealer is often sold on dark web marketplaces as a "malware-as-a-service" platform, providing regular updates, support, and customization options to cybercriminals.
