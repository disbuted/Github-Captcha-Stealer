## **Project Overview**

**Github-Captcha-Stealer** was devised as a CAPTCHA Website intending to lead users to believe they were solving a CAPTCHA challenge. However, the website was actually stealthily deploying an infostealer virus to the user's computer without their knowledge.

The **Lumma Stealer** malware, after installation, is a service that allows cybercriminals to steal a large list of sensitive information from compromised systems such as:

- **Login credentials** of web browsers, FTP clients, and email clients

- **Stored passwords** on the browser and autofill data

- **Session tokens** and cookies, account hijacking will be enabled

- **Private keys** and crypto wallets

- **IP address**, operating system details, and hardware info are part of the System information

- **Clipboard data**, if you had copied passwords, addresses, and other sensitive info

- **Telegram sessions**, they will allow you to get into conversations and accounts

Lumma Stealer is usually found on dark web marketplaces with the name "malware-as-a-service" which is a platform providing regular updates, support, and customization options for cybercriminals.
